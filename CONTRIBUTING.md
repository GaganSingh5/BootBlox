## Contributing Guidelines

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ˜„

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Contributions are handled in the form of Pull Requests. You fork this repository, create a new branch, make relevant changes, and submit a Pull Request â€“ once that's done we'll be able to review your PRs and merge them to the master branch.

### Steps:

-   Fork the repo
-   Fire up a terminal in the repo's directory
-   Type `npm install` and hit enter to install Bootstrap v5 and bootstrap-icons
-   Navigate to a category folder of your choice under `blocks` folder, or if you would like to add a new `block` category, create an issue, and it will be assigned to you
-   Create a new `<blockCategory_num>.html` file. For eg. the `Blog` category already contains 3 templates, so the next one would be `blog_4.html` (You can use the HTML boilerplate provided in `blocks/boilerplate/boilerplate.html`)
-   Try to use minimal inline or external CSS while creating the block template, as this project is based on using Bootstrap
-   Use class `btn-primary`, `bg-primary`, `text-primary` for buttons, backgrounds and text color respectively. The advanced color theme will be applied automatically upon choosing by the user
-   After you are done creating the template block, create a SVG thumbnail and add it in the `assets/thumbs`, and then make a pull request. We will handle it from there to include it in the main page

### Formatting

Format your PR titles likewise:

> [Tag]: Describe change in present tense

Tag can be:

-   Feat (new feature)
-   Fix (bug fix)
-   Refactor (refactoring code)
-   Style (formatting, no code change)
-   Doc (changes to documentation)
-   Test (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)

Remember to:

-   Capitalize the subject line
-   Use the imperative mood in the subject line
